# GitFlow Strategy

## Branches

- main → production
- dev → development
- feature/\* → new features

## Rules

- NEVER push directly to `main`
- All dev must go through `dev`
- PR or merge features into `dev`

## Naming example

- feature/auth-page

# Start a new feature

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feature/<thing>
```

# Finish it

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add <thing>"
git push -u origin feature/<thing>
```

# Then PR → dev

# When dev is stable

```bash
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main
```
